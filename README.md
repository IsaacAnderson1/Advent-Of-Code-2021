# Advent Of Code 2021 

## Overview
This repository documents my learning from the Advent of Code 2021 challenges. Each day focused on different coding concepts and techniques, enhancing my understanding and skills in Java programming. Below is a breakdown of key learnings from selected days.

## Key Learnings by Day

### Day 1: Importing and Manipulating Data
- **Skills Gained**:
  - Imported integers into an `ArrayList`, facilitating easy modifications.
  - Practiced basic `ArrayList` operations such as `arr.get(i)`.

### Day 2: String Manipulation and Parsing
- **Skills Gained**:
  - Utilized `Integer.parseInt(string)` to convert strings containing integers into an integer.
  - Employed `.split()` method to break strings into manageable parts.

### Day 3: Handling Binary Data
- **Skills Gained**:
  - Combined string `ArrayLists` to parse binary strings into integers.
  - Enhanced understanding of binary data manipulation.

### Day 6: Dynamic Data Structures
- **Skills Gained**:
  - Used `ArrayList` methods like `arr.set(index, value)` for updating elements.
  - Employed `arr.add(value)` to append elements, showcasing dynamic array manipulation.

### Day 7: Mathematical Operations and Sorting
- **Skills Gained**:
  - Applied mathematical concepts to compute the median of a dataset.
  - Implemented sorting method for arrays of doubles to accurately calculate medians when dataset size is even.

### Day 9: Working with 2D Arrays
- **Skills Gained**:
  - Transitioned from `ArrayLists` to 2D arrays to better represent grid-like data structures.
  - Simplified conditional logic using the ternary operator (`?:`), making code more concise and readable.
