# Advent-Of-Code-2021

Day 1 - I learned the basics of importing a file integers into an arraylist, making it easy to be modified if needed. It also used some fundamental methods for using an arraylist. EX: arr.get(i)

Day 2 - I learned how to utilize the Integer.parseInt(string) and .split commands/code to convert a string containing an integer to an integer so that I can use that integer for things, such as adding that integer to a total. 

Day 3 - I used combined string arraylists to read the 0's and 1's in the strings of binary and parsing to convert to integers.

Day 6 - I utilized arraylists and their ability to be modified by using arr.set(index, int) to replace numbers in a specific index and using arr.add(int) to add numbers at the end of the arraylist.

Day 7 - I used math skills to determine that I need to find the median. I did that by learning and using a sort method that sorts and array of doubles. I used doubles so that in the case that there were two numbers as the median, I could average them and use the decimal for an exact answer.

Day 9 - I used 2d arrays as the map for lowpoints, so I had to modify the importFile method to import 2d arrays rather than arraylists. I also learned the "? :" operator to simplify my code.
